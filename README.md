# TSMLA™ White Paper

---

### Note on Scope and Clarity

This white paper represents a **mid-phase snapshot** of the TSMLA™ architecture.  
It introduces the core logic of a **non-stochastic, idempotent mirror system** designed to map **contradiction, resonance, and recursive decision structure**.

Because TSMLA™ is not a heuristic, predictive, or learning model, certain terminology and logic forms within this document may appear **compressed or unfamiliar on first read**. This reflects the system’s structural precision rather than abstraction.

To support clarity, **Fractal Labyrinth Systems LLC** is publishing a companion series of **Modular Logic Papers**, each focused on a specific architectural component, for example:

- **Boolean Disambiguation Layer™ (BDL)**
- **Resonant State Function™ (RSF)**
- **Substrate Logic Architecture**
- **Harmonic Compression Layer™ (HCL)**
- **Contradiction Traversal Corridor™ (“The Hallway”)**

Each logic paper expands one layer of the architecture into a self-contained, mathematician-readable artifact, derived directly from the **TSMLA™ Technical Manual (v1.2)** and cross-referenced in the **Modular Logic Roadmap**.

### Overview
This repository hosts the **official TSMLA™ ( Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture )** White Paper.  
It presents the full theoretical and structural foundation of the system: logic-mirroring, resonance-physics modeling, and contradiction traversal under declared state S.
