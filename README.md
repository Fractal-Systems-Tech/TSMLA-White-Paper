# TSMLA™ White Paper

---

### Note on Scope and Clarity

This white paper represents a **mid-phase snapshot** of the TSMLA™ architecture.  
It introduces the core logic of a **non-stochastic, idempotent mirror system** designed to map **contradiction, resonance, and recursive decision structure**.

Because TSMLA™ is not a heuristic, predictive, or learning model, certain terminology and logic forms within this document may appear **compressed or unfamiliar on first read**. This reflects the system’s structural precision rather than abstraction.

To support clarity, **Fractal Labyrinth Systems LLC** is publishing a companion series of **Modular Logic Papers**, each focused on a specific architectural component, for example:

- **Boolean Disambiguation Layer™ (BDL)**
- **Resonant State Function™ (RSF)**
- **Substrate Logic Architecture**
- **Harmonic Compression Layer™ (HCL)**
- **Contradiction Traversal Corridor™ (“The Hallway”)**

Each logic paper expands one layer of the architecture into a self-contained, mathematician-readable artifact, derived directly from the **TSMLA™ Technical Manual (v1.2)** and cross-referenced in the **Modular Logic Roadmap**.

### Overview
This repository hosts the **official TSMLA™ ( Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture )** White Paper.  
It presents the full theoretical and structural foundation of the system: logic-mirroring, resonance-physics modeling, and contradiction traversal under declared state S.

- [Addendum 1: Substrate Architecture & Licensing Framework (v1.1)](TSMLA™_White%20Paper_Substrate_Addendum_FINAL.pdf)  
  > **Note:** Since the publication of Addendum 1, the architecture has evolved to formally include the Galois insertion layer and remove the deprecated CARF model from substrate logic. For the most current expression of substrate dynamics, including tag-weight integrity, mirror-state invariance, and Galios-anchored mirror locks, please reference the companion Modular Logic Paper: [LP-Prime: Non-Stochastic Architecture](https://github.com/Fractal-Systems-Tech/tsmla-non-stochastic-logic-paper/blob/main/TSMLA_LP-Prime_Non-Stochastic_Architecture_C.Bey_2025.pdf). This supersedes prior substrate references made before v1.2.
